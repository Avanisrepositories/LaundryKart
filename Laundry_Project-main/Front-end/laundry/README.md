# Starting with Create React App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

Once inside the project directory, you can use the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload when changes are made.\
Any lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in an interactive watch mode.\
For more information, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production, placing the output in the `build` folder.\
This process optimizes the app for production by bundling React in production mode.

The output is minified, and the filenames include content hashes.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

For more information, check out the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert it!**

If you're unhappy with the default build tools and configurations, you can use the `eject` command at any time. It will remove the build dependency from your project and copy all the necessary configurations (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for complete control.

All other commands will still function, but they'll reference the configurations you've copied, allowing you to make custom adjustments. At this point, you will be responsible for managing everything.

You do not have to use the `eject` feature unless absolutely necessary. The default setup is adequate for small and medium-sized projects, and you should not feel compelled to use this feature unless customization is required.
